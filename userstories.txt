As a programmer
in order to record my thoughts about programming
I would like to be able to write journal entries
that have a standardized format.

As a programmer
in order to review my past work
I'd like to save my journal entries.

As a programmer
in order to benefit from my past experiences
I'd like to be able to search and view past entries.

As a programmer
in order to more efficiently read past posts
I'd like to be able to view all "don't fuck this up again" sections together.

As a programmer
because I'm writing all kinds of personal shit
I'd like my posts to be private and protected
through a user login and password.
